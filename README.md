# Bouncing Balls
## Description
This is a fun simulation I developed using skills I learned in the MITxPRO programming course I am taking.
## Installation
You will need a browser and internet to create this simulation. 
## Usage
This project is simply for entertainment; all you need to do is watch. You don't need to do anything to simulate the bouncing balls. 
## Support
If you need support interpretting the code or creating the simulation, you can reach out to me through my LinkedIn account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/beatriceecook. 
## Roadmap
This is the first of many simulation projects. My next step is to implement commands in my code that change the colors of the balls when they hit a boundary.
